# 2-Tic Tac Toe with Minimax in Java

Tic Tac Toe

Project Details:


This project is a Tic Tac Toe game that will implement a Minimax algorithm in Java This project is divided in 3 parts: The Minimax algorithm, result interpretation, and result output.


Common information:


To facilitate the work between the different parts of this project, I used a String array to reference the players’ position. The array starts with empty positions (all spaces). The player 1 can cast an “X”, while player 2 will be casting an “O” on the array. Tic Tac Toe positions will be called with the following Tic Tac Toe board with the array indexes:

0	1	2

3	4	5

6	7	8


The user is given the option to either play against another player or play against the bot within a loop until deciding to leave the game.
